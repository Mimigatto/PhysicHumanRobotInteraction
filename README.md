## Physical Human Robot Interaction - README

Welcome to the Physical Human Robot Interaction repository! This repository focuses on the field of teleoperation, which involves the remote control of a robot by a human operator. Teleoperation allows humans to perform tasks in environments that may be dangerous or inaccessible, enhancing their capabilities through robotic assistance.

### Repository Contents

This repository provides a detailed analysis of various teleoperation architectures and techniques that enable effective communication and interaction between human operators and robots. The key topics covered include:

1. **Teleoperation Architectures:** The literature explores different teleoperation architectures, including:

   - Four-Channel Bilateral Teleoperation
   - Two-Channel Teleoperation
   - Three-Channel Position-Force and Position (PF-P) Teleoperation

   These architectures facilitate communication and control between the human operator and the robot, enabling the operator to manipulate the robot's movements and actions.

2. **Kalman Filter/Predictor and Kalman Smoother:** The use of Kalman Filter/Predictor and Kalman Smoother techniques in teleoperation is discussed. These techniques aid in improving the accuracy of position, velocity, and force estimation in teleoperation systems. Linear regression is employed to predict the motor torque, enhancing the overall performance and reliability of the teleoperation system.

3. **Communication Channel Optimization:** The repository explores tank-based and scattering wave-based architectures designed to eliminate significant delays in the communication channel. By optimizing the communication protocols and reducing latency, these architectures enhance the real-time interaction between the human operator and the robot.

4. **Applications in Physical Human Robot Interaction:** The literature provided in this repository sheds light on the broader field of Physical Human Robot Interaction (pHRI) and its applications in teleoperation. pHRI encompasses the study and development of systems and interfaces that enable seamless interaction between humans and robots, opening up possibilities for collaborative work, assistance, and augmentation.
